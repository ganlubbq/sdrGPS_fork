First make sure your OS has gcc-c++ and ncurses packages are installed. 

Run the following commands to verify:

# rpm -qa | grep gcc

# rpm -qa | grep ncurses

Then run the make command to compile

# make

Finally run the executable 

# ./sdrGPS

The display requires at least 25X100 windows size to display all the information, so be prepared to change your console size if the program complains about that. 

The logged data are saved at data/ folder. Use Matlab to plot them. For the file format, please read the source code in gps_controller.c, gps_nav_fix.cc and kalman.cc. In the scilab/ folder, there are four script file to display the processing result. "disp_tracking.m" to show the tracking loop status, "disp_ls_fix.m" to show the LS fix result, "disp_p_fix.m" to show the P-model KF result, "disp_pv_fix.m" to show the PV-model KF result. 

Enjoy.
